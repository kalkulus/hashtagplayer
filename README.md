# HashtagPlayer - Creates a playlist of Youtube videos from tweets with #hashtag

People use hashtags to tweet music videos all the time and there's some good music out there.

But the only way to hear everything is to go to Twitter search, search for a #hashtag and then go from one tweet to another and play the videos.

And that get's boring really quickly. So I made #HashtagPlayer.

It is very much a demo/proof of concept at the moment, but it was fun to do it and I actually use it.

Supports only Youtube and it is limited in a number of tweets it can get. I might add Soundcloud or something later.

Still, I hope you have fun with it :)
